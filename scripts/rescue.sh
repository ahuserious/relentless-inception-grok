# rescue.sh — pick up a rescue trigger and drive the 7-step rescue cycle.
#
# This is a STATE MACHINE — it cannot spawn Claude Code subagents on its
# own (only the LLM-side orchestrator can do that). What it does:
#
#   1. Claims the oldest trigger file from $RELENTLESS_INCEPTION_HOME/triggers/.
#   2. Scaffolds the rescue cycle directory.
#   3. Reads the trigger + the active run manifest + the last K session events
#      into a curated bundle, written to .../rescues/<cycle>/inputs.md.
#   4. Builds a RELENTLESS-INBOX prompt that instructs the next interactive
#      session (post-/clear) to perform steps 1-5 of the documented rescue
#      flow (diagnosis + consortium + triple-gate + approved.md + self-improve).
#   5. Pipes that prompt through relentless_relay.sh's mechanism: writes to
#      lateral-pass/pending-relentless.md and (if tmux is available) signals
#      the relay daemon to fire /clear + paste.
#
# The LLM, upon resuming with the fresh /clear, runs steps 1-5 (calling
# adversarial_review.sh for the gates and Agent for the consortium), writes
# approved.md, and resumes the run from the last checkpoint.
#
# Idempotent: rescues are tracked by trigger filename; a re-invocation with
# the same trigger file is a no-op (the file gets moved to processed/ on
# first claim).
