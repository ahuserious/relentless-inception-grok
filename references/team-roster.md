# Team roster

This skill spawns a typed cast of subagents. Defaults come from `agents/` files; the
user's spec in the parent monorepo's `docs/SPEC-original.md` is the source of truth for
any role tuning. Models all run at 1M-context variants; effort flags route through
codex/openrouter.

| Role                       | Default model            | Default effort   | When fired                                                       |

Read `agents/<role>.md` for the prompt template each role uses. Each file is
self-contained so the orchestrator can dispatch without re-deriving instructions.
`agents/<role>.md` files are loaded per-spawn; the orchestrator doesn't read them all up
front.
